# Task 1: Hello World

## Overview

This task demonstrates the basics of Docker by running a simple "hello-world" container. It's an essential first step in understanding Docker's workflow and ensures that Docker is correctly installed and operational. This project is performed within the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), utilizing Google Cloud Shell for executing Docker commands.

## Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud account and access to Google Cloud Console.
- Access to Google Cloud Shell.

## Running the Hello World Container
To run the "hello-world" Docker container, follow these steps:

### 1. Open Google Cloud Console

Log into your Google Cloud account and navigate to the Google Cloud Console.

### 2. Activate Cloud Shell

At the top right corner of the Google Cloud Console, click on the Cloud Shell icon to activate a Cloud Shell session.

### 3. Run the Docker Command

In the Cloud Shell, enter the following command to run the "hello-world" Docker container:

### 4. Observe the Output

Upon successful execution, you will see a message indicating that your Docker installation appears to be working correctly. This message is generated by the "hello-world" container and confirms that Docker can pull images from Docker Hub and run containers.

### Understanding the Output

The "hello-world" Docker container provides a step-by-step explanation of what it does:
- The Docker client contacts the Docker daemon.
- The Docker daemon pulls the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
- The Docker daemon creates a new container from that image which runs the executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
- The Docker daemon streams that output to the Docker client, which sends it to your terminal.
