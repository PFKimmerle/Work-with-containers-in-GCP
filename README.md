# Work with Containers in GCP

## Project Overview

This project documents a hands-on lab focused on working with containers in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It covers the essentials of Docker, including building, running, debugging containers, and pushing Docker images to Google Artifact Registry. 

## Objectives

- Understand the basics of Docker containers and images.
- Learn how to build, run, and debug Docker containers.
- Explore the process of pushing Docker images to Google Artifact Registry and running containers from these images.

## Repository Structure

- `task-1-hello-world`: Running a simple "hello-world" Docker container.
- `task-2-build`: Building a Docker image for a Node.js application.
- `task-3-run`: Running the Node.js application container.
- `task-4-debug`: Debugging Docker containers using logs and interactive sessions.
- `task-5-publish`: Pushing a Docker image to Google Artifact Registry and running a container from it.
- `screenshots`: Visual guides and references for steps performed in the GCP console and Cloud Shell.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.

## Prerequisites

- Access to Google Cloud Platform with an active account.
- Basic understanding of Docker and containerization concepts.
- Familiarity with Google Cloud Console and Cloud Shell.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps outlined in each task directory's README.md file. Refer to the `screenshots` directory for visual aids on completing each task within the GCP console.
